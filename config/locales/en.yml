      question_1: 'Q: How does it work?'

      question_4: 'Q: Who is the team behind movido?'
      question_5: 'Q: How do I know if my purchase was successful?'
      question_6: 'Q: I have not received my phone / wifi box / transport card yet – what shall I do?'
      question_7: 'Q: How can I cancel my contract?'
      answer_1: "A: movido bundles all services you need in your new city on one platform. You sign up once and can start selecting your new bank account, local phone number, broadband, gym and many more services you need right away. We synchronize these service offers and prices continuously with our partners so that you always subscribe to the latest offers in the market. In your profile section, you can afterwards conveniently manage your contracts"
      answer_2: "A: movido is completely free of charge for you, we work on a commission basis only paid by the service provider. Due to the large number of users we refer, we often achieve special conditions. So on top of the perfect offer, you most likely get it at the cheapest price in the market."
      answer_3: "A: Most of the contracts such as phone, broadband, gym, etc. require a local bank account. We therefore recommend to start with conveniently setting up your transferwise, bunq or revolut account. Afterwards, an apartment will give you the chance to have a fixed address. Check out our cool housing offers. All other services can then be booked in parallel."
      answer_4: "A: We are a team with diverse backgrounds – from finance professionals to front/back-end developers. However, what we all share is the cumbersome admin experience when moving to a new city and the vision to make this process easier for you."
      answer_5: "A: Once you have submitted the order form, you will receive two emails – the first one will confirm your order. Now, movido will work in the background with the service provider to get your contract set up. Especially, when it comes to housing, this may take up to 48 hours. The second email with the purchase confirmation then guarantees you that your purchase was successful."
      answer_6: "A: Please note that this will take up to 3 business days depending on the provider. You can also always get in touch with our support team – they will be able to trace your delivery and help you."
      answer_7: "A: In your “My profile” section, you have a good overview of all your contracts. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality reasons, we will not be able to cancel every type of contract. For these, you will either be provided a link to direct you to the respective action in no time or the helpline number to do so via phone."

      headline: "New to the city and don’t have internet yet?  <br>Let movido find the best broadband offer to suit your needs!"
      question: "Did you know that there are more than 200 broadband providers and over 1,000 different broadband offers available in Europe?"
      answer: "Finding your ideal internet provider is complicated!"
      explanation: "To begin with, each broadband company requires you to complete several forms including your precise address and personal details to get the application approved. The offers vary in terms of upload and download speed (what does this even mean?), contract duration, and various extras you might not need that make a comparison nearly impossible. On top of this, each provider also has its own customer service hotline and contact e-mails with variable levels of support quality. <br><br>You end up spending days comparing all offers to get your WiFi set up."
      solution: "We have a better solution: movido, an all-in-one platform, that makes all these offers comparable and simplifies the subscription process."

      question: "Did you know that there are more than <strong>150 mobile providers</strong> and <strong>2,000 different mobile offers </strong>available in Europe?"
      answer: "Finding your ideal mobile offer is not easy!"
      explanation: "To begin with, each mobile company requires you to complete several forms including personal details to get the application approved. The large number of offers comes with various call and data allowances, contract lengths and extra services that make a direct comparison nearly impossible. If you have a question, you will need to find out each company’s dedicated service hotline and spend endless time on the phone to maybe get an answer to your question. Not to mention, every company has its own terms and conditions, refund and cancellation policies including minimum notice periods, making it very difficult to switch your contract or simply cancel it. <br><br>You would end up spending days trying to compare all offers to finally get your local mobile number"

      headline: "New to the city and need a local bank account?  <br>Let movido find the best offers for you!"
      question: "Did you know that there are two types of banks in the market: high street banks and so called neobanks? <br><br>Contrary to traditional high street banks, neobanks are 100% digital and use mobile apps and online platforms to support their customers, rather than traditional physical branches. They are also growing in popularity thanks to lower currency exchange fees and convenience with a simpler and faster way to manage your money."
      answer: "Confused with different banking options available?"
      explanation: "To begin with, each bank requires you to fill in several forms such as personal details, proof of address, ID verification (and many more), to get the application approved. The fees for banking operations such as overdraft facility, credit card spend limit, and especially currency exchange rates vary greatly between banks. Not to mention the time it takes until your account is finally open – in most cases, you need a physical appointment at your local branch before your account can be activated. Choose the wrong bank and you might have to wait for weeks until your account is finally activated only to end up pay higher fees when you send / receive money from home. "

      answer: "Finding your ideal accommodation quickly is a big challenge!"
      explanation: "As a newbie in your city, going through the process of securing an accommodation can be stressful, and even risky if you are talking to inexperienced agencies or landlords.
