Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,
I know what you’re thinking:

“I still have lots of time to think about housing, airport pick-up, local SIM card, public transportation, etc. for my trip abroad - I really don’t want to deal with that stuff now.”🤦

Don’t worry, we get it: these things can be really cumbersome, nothing anybody wants to deal with. Except for us, we help you make your moving process as simple as possible (and help you save money along the way....).

So, don’t miss out, just reply to this email and I will answer all questions you might still have (and remember, there’s no such thing as a stupid question 😋)

Have an awesome day,
